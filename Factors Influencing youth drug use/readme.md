#Abstract
'''

Teen drug usage is a matter of concern for society that needs to be addressed. 
In this study we hope to find the elements that contribute to some teenagers' 
drug usage by evaluating the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data by utilizing
decision trees as a guide. The data is explored through classification and regression analysis that 
addresses the following questions; whether teens used drugs or not, and how frequently was their usage
through quantitative and categorical variables. Each question reveals an additional component of the picture 
concerning youth drug use. We use tree diagrams to visually trace paths that lead to answers, making sense of the 
complexities of teen decision-making. Investigating why youth may use more or fewer drugs. By identifying what is 
most important in predicting youth drug usage, we obtain insight into what impacts teens' drug decisions. 
These results are approached with caution, hoping to communicate them in a way that is beneficial and respectful to teenagers.
At each step various models are trained leading to, Boosting with an accuracy of 90% giving the best accuracy when the exploration is to identify the elements that trigger the use of marijuana on a binary response variable. 
Furthermore, the Decision Tree is chosen as the best model with an accuracy of 88% presenting the best insight on factors that influence the levels of marijuana usage. 
As per the regression analysis, among all modeling methods conducted Random Forest is seen to out outperform the others through having the lowest Mean Squared Error. 
Finally, this study is a journey of exploration, utilizing decision trees and its ensemble methods that utilize decision trees as their base models to shed light on the variables influencing youth drug use,
allowing us to better help them in making healthy choices.'''
