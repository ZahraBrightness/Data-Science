#Abstract:
'''
The project aims to analyze the impact of environmental and health factors on public health status 
across over 180 countries through the implementation of unsupervised learning methods. T
wo datasets include various attributes such as physical inactivity, air pollution, dietary habits, 
and specific disease burdens are utilized to understand their overall impact on public health.
For this unsupervised analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and singular vector decomposition (SVD) are chosen for reducing the dimensionality of the data, 
followed by K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering were employed.This processes shows significant patterns a
nd groupings, uncovering hidden trends and relationships between different health risk factors and disease burdens. 
These insights could help inform public health strategies and interventions.
The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of unsupervised learning algorithms in handling complex, high-dimensional data and their potential contribution to health analytics.'''
